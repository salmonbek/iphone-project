        <p style="color: greenyellow; font-size: 30px;">The iPhone is a line of smartphones developed and marketed by
            Apple that run iOS,
            the company's own mobile
            operating
            system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by thenâ€“Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at
            Macworld 2007, and
            launched later that year. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS versions; the
            most recent
            models being the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, and the higher-end iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max. As of January 1,
            2024, more
            than 2.3 billion iPhones have been sold, making Apple the largest vendor of mobile phones in 2023.

            The original iPhone was the first mobile phone to use multi-touch technology. Throughout its history, the
            iPhone has
            gained larger, higher-resolution displays, video-recording functionality, waterproofing, and many
            accessibility
            features. Up to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel, with the iPhone 5s
            and later
            integrating a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since the iPhone X,[note 2] iPhone models have switched to a
            nearly
            <u>
                bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition in place of Touch ID for authentication,
                and
                increased
                use of gestures in place of the home button for navigation.[note 3]

            </u>
            The iPhone, which operates using Apple's proprietary iOS software, is one of the two major smartphone
            platforms in the
            world, alongside Android. The first-generation iPhone was described by Steve Jobs as a "revolution" for the
            mobile phone
            industry. The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the slate smartphone form factor, and with creating
            a large
            market for smartphone apps, or "app economy", laying the foundation for the boom of the market for mobile
            devices. In
            <span style="color: brown;">
                addition to the apps that come pre-installed on iOS, there are nearly 2 million apps available for
                download
                from Apple's
            </span>
            mobile distribution marketplace, the App Store, as of August 2024.
